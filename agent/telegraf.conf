  ## Default data collection interval for all inputs
  interval = "10s"
  ## Rounds collection interval to 'interval'
  ## ie, if interval="10s" then always collect on :00, :10, :20, etc.
  round_interval = true

  ## Telegraf will send metrics to outputs in batches of at most
  ## metric_batch_size metrics.
  ## This controls the size of writes that Telegraf sends to output plugins.
  metric_batch_size = 1000

  ## Maximum number of unwritten metrics per output.  Increasing this value
  ## allows for longer periods of output downtime without dropping metrics at the
  ## cost of higher maximum memory usage.
  metric_buffer_limit = 50000

  ## Collection jitter is used to jitter the collection by a random amount.
  ## Each plugin will sleep for a random time within jitter before collecting.
  ## This can be used to avoid many plugins querying things like sysfs at the
  ## same time, which can have a measurable effect on the system.
  collection_jitter = "0s"

  ## Collection offset is used to shift the collection by the given amount.
  ## This can be be used to avoid many plugins querying constraint devices
  ## at the same time by manually scheduling them in time.
  # collection_offset = "0s"

  ## Default flushing interval for all outputs. Maximum flush_interval will be
  ## flush_interval + flush_jitter
  flush_interval = "300s"
  ## Jitter the flush interval by a random amount. This is primarily to avoid
  ## large write spikes for users running a large number of telegraf instances.
  ## ie, a jitter of 5s and interval 10s means flushes will happen every 10-15s
  flush_jitter = "0s"



## OUTPUTS
## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/outputs/sumologic
[[outputs.sumologic]]
  ## Unique URL generated for your HTTP Metrics Source.
  ## This is the address to send metrics to.
  # url = "https://events.sumologic.net/receiver/v1/http/<UniqueHTTPCollectorCode>"
  url = "$URL"
  ## Data format to be used for sending metrics.
  ## This will set the "Content-Type" header accordingly.
  ## Currently supported formats:
  ## * graphite - for Content-Type of application/vnd.sumologic.graphite
  ## * carbon2 - for Content-Type of application/vnd.sumologic.carbon2
  ## * prometheus - for Content-Type of application/vnd.sumologic.prometheus

  ## https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/Sources/02Sources-for-Hosted-Collectors/HTTP-Source/Upload-Metrics-to-an-HTTP-Source#content-type-headers-for-metrics
  ##
  ## NOTE:
  ## When unset, telegraf will by default use the influx serializer which is currently unsupported
  ## in HTTP Source.
  data_format = "graphite"

  ## Timeout used for HTTP request
  timeout = "1m"

  ## Max HTTP request body size in bytes before compression (if applied).
  ## By default 1MB is recommended.
  ## NOTE:
  ## Bear in mind that in some serializer a metric even though serialized to multiple
  ## lines cannot be split any further so setting this very low might not work
  ## as expected.
  max_request_body_size = 1000000
